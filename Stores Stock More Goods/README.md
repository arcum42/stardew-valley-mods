# Stores Stock More Goods

Not a terribly inventive name, I'll admit, but it covers what this mod does. I've expanded out the stock of a number of stores.

* Pierre's Shop
    He now sells a Scarecrow, Basic Sprinklers, Quality Sprinklers, and Iridium Sprinklers. The latter two only show up in his stock when you have the recipe. Basic Sprinklers, OTOH, I think are underused, so he sells them from the beginning. He'll also eventually carry a seed maker.

* JojaMart
    JojaMart now sells Milk, Cheese, Vinegar, Salad, Spaghetti, Pepper Poppers, and Pizza. It has a sign for milk, and Shane has sent you some of those supposedly from JojaMart, so why not actually be able to buy them? They also sell battery packs (once you can make lightning rods), and the three types of sprinklers, and a seed maker, while undercutting Pierre's prices. most things I added for JojaMart are cheaper then elsewhere. Everyone talks about their deals, so let's actually have some. Of course, if you complete the Jaja route, you can now buy Soda Machines, and those aren't exactly cheap...

* Robin's Shop
    She now sells hardwood and clay. Buy them now, because her prices go up year 2! She sells tree fertilizer, once you can craft them, and is willing to build you chests, preserve jars, kegs, and casks, once you can make them.

* Clint's Shop
    He's willing to sell you copper, iron, and gold bars for the price of 4 ores and a piece of coal. Prices go up year 2, but he adds iridium. He'll also sell you furnaces.

* Marnie's Farm
    She's running a farm. She'll sell you large (cow and goat) milk, large eggs, and wool, all gold quality (and priced as such). She'll also sell you mayonnaise machines, cheese presses, oil makers, and looms, once you are at the right level to make them. She'll sell you an auto petter, if you complete the community center (for way more than JojaMart would have.).

This has not been extensively tested, so use at your own risk. Prices are a bit haphazard, and I may very well end up adjusting them.

This has now been converted over to use Content Patcher for 1.6 instead of the Shop Tile Framework, so if you had that installed from a previous version, you may remove it, unless anything else uses it.
